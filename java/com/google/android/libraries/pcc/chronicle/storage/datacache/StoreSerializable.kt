/**
 * Interfaces to support serialization and deserialization of the objects needed to be stored on
 * disk through [DataCacheStorage].
 *
 * The [StoreSerializable] interface should be implemented by the data type class which is stored in
 * [DataCacheStorage].
 *
 * The [Deserializer] interface should be implemented by the companion object for the data type
 * class which implemented [StoreSerializable].
 *
 * Example: data class Foo(val data : String) : StoreSerializable { override fun fun
 * toSerializedString(): String { // Do something and return String. }
 *
 *     companion objet : Deserializer<Foo>{
 *       fun fromSerializedString(str : String): Foo? {
 *         // Do something and return Foo?.
 *       }
 *     }
