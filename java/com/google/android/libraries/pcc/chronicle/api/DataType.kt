 * This is how data stewards specify configuration information for the data that they want to store
 * and manage using Chronicle. Data stewards should define a singleton object that extends the
 * [DataType] interface and may add extra configuration parameters to this singleton if needed:
 * ```
 * object MyPrivateDataType : DataType {
 *      override val descriptor = ...
 *      override val managementStrategy = ...
 *      override val connectionTypes = ...
 *      // Additional configuration parameters
 *      const val MAX_ENTITIES = 1000
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * [ConnectionProvider]s must provide a [DataType] object to [Chronicle] to declare how they
 * participate in data flow.
